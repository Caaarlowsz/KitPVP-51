v0.0.2:

/ Fixed an issue in SignChange where a permission error was given if a player (without the permission 'kitpvp.admin.sign') placed a sign without writing [kitpvp] at the top
/ Fixed an issue where the constructor of each file class was saving config.yml instead of its own file
+ Compiling in Java 11 (for some reason, it wasn't compiling the correct way in v0.0.1)
