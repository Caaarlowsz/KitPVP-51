v0.0.6:
+ Fixed an critical issue where files won't load properly without interrupting each other

+ ToolActions - tool usage will be proceeded and saved here

+ Added a few event listeners to prevent players breaking the mapsetup logic
  -> Player quit event: if a player leaves, the inventory will return
  -> Player drop item event: a player can't drop a map setup item anymore
  -> Inventory click event: it isn't possible to drag items over to a other slot
  -> Block place event: this event is cancelled to be able to proceed item usage
  -> Player pickup item event: a player can't pick up items while in setup

+ Tool names (previously hardcoded) are moved to config.yml

! Players in creative can double a map setup item to bypass click event cancellation (tags: TODO)
! Setup tool 'Finish' can be placed, while the other tools (LWPP and red wool) can't be

+ WorldTp is now working correctly
+ CreateMap util added, tools can be given to player, but they're not working yet

+ Compiling in Java 11 (for some reason, it wasn't compiling the correct way in v0.0.1)
